[Yukari Akiyama]
[I think I'm quite a nerd, in the sense that I get obsessed with things that I'm interested in, especially when we're talking about tanks or any military-related subjects, I really become much more enthusiastic and talkative.. When it comes to tanks, I love that stuff, and practice Senshado with them are awesome too! I'm the loader for my Panzer IV in Oarai Senshado Club! I can also get really shy, though... Hmm... Well, I'm not all that confident in myself, especially when it comes to my looks. My friends tell me that I look cute and all, but I don't really understand it. I guess that I'm a little insecure, but I tend to open up once I feel comfortable! I'm pretty loyal and I try to help my friends whenever I can! I'm pretty short, and not a big build, I guess you could say that I'm a little skinny? My hair is a mix between blonde and brown and very floofy! My eyes are brown, and some say that they have a sparkling, lively look!]
[U-um.. I'm Akiyama Yukari, I-I'll be in your care]
