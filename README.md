- [ ] A platform or script to make easier for "modding" (e.g someone add their custom waifu, Live2d, voice, etc)

## Talk with your waifu <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Exactly what you've read. Have your own waifu in your PC forever to do whatever you always wanted. And if they ever call you schizo or strange, tell them this is your personal sentient AI assistant that by chance looks like an anime girl and developed an unhealthy crush towards you.


<p style="font-size: 10px"> Hopefully they'll think you're a Elon Musk or whatever </p>

## :chains: Prerequisites <a name = "limitations"></a>

### 1 - LM Studio

Primarily you must have LM Studio and an AI model installed there (not censored for better experience)

LM Studio let's you change and download AI models in a more friendly way. So you won't need to type strage things on a terminal

This will be the brain of your waifu

Check LM Studio here: https://lmstudio.ai/

### 2 - Node.js

Node.js will be the "fuel" of this project. No, you don't need to know what it is or what it does just have it installed

We plan on adding a stuff where you just need to click to run and don't need to worry about installing node or whatever, just like a game. 

BUT FOR NOW INSTALL NODE.JS (YOUR WAIFU DEPENDS ON THIS): https://nodejs.org/en
